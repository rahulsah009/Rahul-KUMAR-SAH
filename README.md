## 📁 Program List

# Problem-1: Create a small calculator which performs operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division using class.
  Calculator inputs :> ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘type of operation’
  Datatype :> ‘a’ = double, ‘b’ = double, ‘type of operation’ = string
  
**Input:**
a = 10.5
b = 2
operation = mul
- **Output:**
Result: 21.0

# Problem-2: With a single integer as the input, generate the following until a = x [series of numbers as shown in below examples]
 
  Output: (examples)
    1) input a = 1, then output : 1 <br>
    2) input a = 2, then output : 1, 3 <br>
    3) input a = 3, then output : 1, 3, 5 <br>
    4) input a = 4, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7 <br>
    .
    .
    5) input a = x, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7, ....... <br>
 

- **Input:**
a = 5 <br>
- **Output:**
1, 3, 5, 7, 9


# Problem-3: With a single integer as the input, generate the following until a = x [series of numbers as shown in below examples]
 
  Output: (examples)
    1) input a = 1, then output : 1 <br>
    2) input a = 2, then output : 1 <br>
    3) input a = 3, then output : 1, 3, 5 <br>
    4) input a = 4, then output : 1, 3, 5 <br>
    5) input a = 5, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 <br>
    6) input a = 6, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 <br>
    .
    .
    7) input a = x, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7, ....... <br>
    
 - **Input:**
     a = 6 <br>
- **Output:**
    1, 3, 5, 7, 9


  # Problem-4: Get the total count of number listed in the dictionary which is multiple of [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
  (examples)
  input: [1,2,8,9,12,46,76,82,15,20,30] <br>
  Output: 
    {1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1} <br>

  **Input:**
Array: [1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 46, 76, 82, 15, 20, 30] <br>
- **Output:**
{1=11, 2=8, 3=4, 4=4, 5=3, 6=2, 7=0, 8=1, 9=1}
